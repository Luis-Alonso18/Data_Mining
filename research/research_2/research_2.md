### **Type of probability distributions Statistics**

#### **Discrete distributions**
- **Discrete uniform distribution (a,b):** The discrete uniform distribution describes the behavior of a discrete variable that can take n different values with the same probability each of them.
- **Binomial distribution (n,p):** This distribution appears naturally when performing independent repetitions of an experiment that has a binary response, generally classified as "success" or "failure"; This experiment is called the Bernoulli experiment.
- **Hypergeometric distribution (N,R,n):** The hypergeometric distribution usually appears in sampling processes without replacement, in which the presence or absence of a certain characteristic is investigated.
- **Geometric distribution (p):** The geometric distribution allows calculating the probability that a number k of repetitions must be performed before obtaining a success for the first time; this probability decreases as k increases, so the probability mass function is always decreasing.
- **Negative binomial distribution (r,p):** An obvious generalization of the geometric distribution appears if it is assumed that an experiment is continued until a certain event, of probability p, occurs for the nth time. The random variable that gives the probability of k failures before the rth success is obtained follows a negative binomial distribution with parameters r and p, BN(r,p).
- **Pascal distribution (r,p):** The number of tests necessary to obtain r successes, where p is the probability of success, is a random variable that follows a Pascal distribution with parameters r and p.
- **Poisson distribution (𝜆):** In general, the Poisson distribution with parameter 𝜆 can be used as an approximation of the binomial, Bin(n, p), if the number of trials n is large, but the probability of success p is small , where 𝜆 = np; we can consider that the Poisson-binomial approximation is “good” if n≥20 and p≤0.05 and “very good” if n≥100 and p≤0.01.
  
#### **Continuous distributions**
- **Uniform or rectangular distribution (a,b):** The uniform distribution is useful to describe a random variable with constant probability over the interval (a,b) in which it is defined and is denoted by U(a,b). It is also known by the name of the rectangular distribution due to the appearance of its density function.
- **Normal distribution (μ,𝝈):** The normal distribution is fully defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation or typical deviation (𝜎). Its density function is symmetric with respect to the mean and the standard deviation indicates the greater or lesser degree of opening of the curve that, due to its appearance, is usually called a Gauss bell. This distribution is denoted by N(μ,𝜎).
- **Lognormal distribution (μ,𝜎):** The variable resulting from applying the exponential function to a variable that is normally distributed with mean μ and standard deviation 𝜎, follows a lognormal distribution with parameters μ (scale) and 𝜎 (shape). In other words, if a variable X follows a lognormal distribution, then the variable lnX is normally distributed.
- **Logistic distribution (a, b):** The logistic distribution is used in the study of the temporary growth of variables, in particular, demographic ones. In biology it has been applied, for example, to model the growth of yeast cells, and to represent dose-response curves in bioassays.
- **Beta distribution (p,q):** The beta distribution is suitable for continuous random variables that take values in the interval (0,1), which makes it very suitable for modeling proportions. In Bayesian inference, for example, it is widely used as a prior distribution when the observations have a binomial distribution.
- **Gamma distribution (a,p):** The gamma distribution can be characterized as follows: if we are interested in the occurrence of an event generated by a Poisson process of mean 𝜆, the variable that measures the time elapsed until obtaining n occurrences of the event follows a gamma distribution with parameters a = n𝜆 (scale) and p = n (shape). It is denoted by Gamma(a,p).
- **Exponential distribution (𝜆):** The exponential distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution and the continuous equivalent of the discrete geometric distribution. This distribution law describes processes in which it is interesting to know the time until a certain event occurs; in particular, it is used to model survival times.
- **Chi-square distribution (n):** It is the distribution that follows the sum of the squares of n independent variables and identically distributed according to a standard normal distribution, N(0,1).
- **Student's t-distribution (n):** The Student's t-distribution is completely defined by its degrees of freedom, n, and is denoted by tn. It arises when studying the ratio between a random variable with a standard normal distribution and the square root of the ratio between a random variable with a chi-square distribution and its degrees of freedom (n), the two variables being independent.
- **Snedecor's F distribution (n,m):** Another important distribution associated with the normal distribution is the one defined as the ratio of two independent random variables with a chi-square distribution divided by their respective degrees of freedom, n and m; the resulting random variable follows a Snedecor F distribution with parameters n and m (denoted by Fn,m).
- **Cauchy distribution (μ,𝛳):** The Cauchy distribution depends on two parameters: scale (μ) and location (𝛳); in the particular case that μ=1 and 𝛳=0, it is called the standard Cauchy distribution.
- **Weibull distribution (a, b):** The Weibull distribution is fully defined by two parameters, shape (a) and scale (b). In the particular case that a=1, we have the exponential distribution, and if a = 2 and b = √2𝜎 it is called the Rayleigh distribution.
- **Laplace distribution (a, b):** This distribution is determined by two parameters, one of situation (a) and another of scale (b). Its density function is symmetric and the location parameter determines its axis of symmetry, as well as being the point where the function reaches its maximum value in the form of a sharp peak.
- **Pareto distribution (𝛼,x0):** It is a biparametric distribution, with parameters of shape (𝛼) and situation (x0). The parameter x0 is a position indicator (minimum value) that, in economic terms, can be interpreted as the minimum income of the population. The parameter 𝛼 is associated with dispersion, where the higher the value, the more concentrated Pareto densities are obtained in the vicinity of x0, that is, less scattered.
- **Triangular distribution (a, c, b):** The name of this distribution is given by the shape of its density function. This model provides a first approximation when little information is available, so that only the minimum (pessimistic value), the maximum (optimistic value) and the mode (most likely value) need to be known. These three values are the parameters that characterize the triangular distribution and are denoted by a, b and c, respectively.
